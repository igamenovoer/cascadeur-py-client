# index

## Overview

This page is the cleaned entry point to the Cascadeur Python API. It serves as an index that describes the purpose and scope of the API rather than a specific class or function. The original source included a very large, duplicated inventory pulled from the HTML docs; this version preserves only essential context. Refer to the dedicated module and class pages for detailed signatures and usage.

## Function Definition

```python
# Module: index
# This is an index module; no direct public class or function signatures are documented here.
```

## Usage Notes

- Use this index to understand the high-level organization of the API and discover available modules and domains.
- Navigate to specific module pages (for example, csc, csc.math, csc.view, csc.app, etc.) for concrete class and function definitions, parameters, and return types.
