# Installation

First of all, we recommend to check [**System Requirements**](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/6).

The process of installation might differ depending on the operating system you use:

[**Installing Cacadeur on Windows**](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/7)

[**Installing Cascadeur on Ubuntu**](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/69)

Note

Application data (settings, temp file etc.) is not stored in the main program folder.

See [**File Structure**](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/71) to learn where it can be found

Once installation is complete, you'll need to **[Sign In](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/101).**

After this, the program is all set and ready for work. See the [**next chapter**](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/8) if you'd like to learn the basics of workflow.

And if you need to remove Cascadeur from your computer, see [**Uninstall**](https://cascadeur.com/help/uninstall).
