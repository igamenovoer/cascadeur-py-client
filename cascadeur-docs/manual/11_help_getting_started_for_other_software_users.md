# For Other Software Users

This page is intended for users who have previous experience with 3D animation software.

The animation process in Cascadeur is similar to popular 3d software, but not without some significant differences.

First of all: Cascadeur is **not** a general-purpose 3D solution. You cannot create 3D models, nor can you skin it to joints/bones. Characters should be prepared for animation beforehand, in other programs.

Animation in Cascadeur is created in the same manner as it is in other software,Â but not without some significant differences. These differences are covered in the guides you can find on this page. Use them to quickstart with Cascadeur and adapt your existing animation skills for a new environment.
