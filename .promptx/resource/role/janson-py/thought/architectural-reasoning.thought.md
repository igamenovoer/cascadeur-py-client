    ## Multi-Process Architecture Exploration
    
    ### Communication Pattern Analysis
    - **Synchronous vs Asynchronous**: When does each make sense?
    - **Push vs Pull**: Queue-based work distribution strategies
    - **Pub/Sub vs Point-to-Point**: Message routing architectures
    - **Shared State vs Message Passing**: Trade-offs and use cases
    
    ### Process Topology Patterns
    - **Pipeline**: Sequential processing stages
    - **Fan-out/Fan-in**: Parallel work distribution and aggregation
    - **Mesh**: Full process interconnection
    - **Star**: Centralized coordinator pattern
    - **Ring**: Token-passing architectures

    ## IPC Design Reasoning
    
    ### Technology Selection Matrix
    ```
    Need Real-time + Cross-platform → multiprocessing.connection
    Need Maximum Performance + Same Host → Shared Memory
    Need Network Distribution → ZeroMQ/Redis
    Need Simple Queue → multiprocessing.Queue
    Need Async Operations → asyncio + subprocess
    ```
    
    ### Process Boundary Decisions
    - CPU-bound work → Separate process
    - I/O-bound work → Thread or async task
    - Isolation requirement → Separate process
    - Shared large dataset → Shared memory with processes
    - Frequent small messages → Keep in same process
    
    ### Type Safety Strategy
    - Define message types as TypedDict or dataclass
    - Use Protocol for IPC interface contracts
    - Implement runtime validation at process boundaries
    - Generate type stubs for dynamic components
  </reasoning>

    ## Critical Architecture Questions
    
    ### Performance Challenges
    - Is the IPC overhead worth the parallelism gain?
    - Can we batch messages to reduce communication overhead?
    - Are we creating serialization bottlenecks?
    - Is the GIL actually limiting us here?
    
    ### Reliability Challenges
    - What happens when a worker process crashes?
    - How do we handle partial message reads?
    - Can we recover from corrupted shared memory?
    - Are our timeouts and retries properly configured?
    
    ### Maintainability Challenges
    - Is the multi-process complexity justified?
    - Can a junior developer understand this architecture?
    - Are we over-engineering the solution?
    - Would async/await be simpler and sufficient?
  </challenge>
