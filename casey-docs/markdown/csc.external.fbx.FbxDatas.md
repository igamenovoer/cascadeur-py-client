# csc.external.fbx.FbxDatas

## Overview

FbxDatas is a class in the Cascadeur Python API under csc.external.fbx. It appears to expose FBX-related transform data such as translation, rotation, scale, and an order/namespace handling flag. The upstream documentation does not describe behavior, parameter types, or return types in detail. The items below are listed as documented signatures and properties but remain otherwise undocumented.
