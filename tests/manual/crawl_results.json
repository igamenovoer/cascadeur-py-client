Autosaving is performed automatically, its frequency can be adjusted in Cascadeur's [**Settings** window](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/94).\n\n\nThe files in this folder can be accessed by selecting **Open autosave file** from the [**File** menu](https://cascadeur.com/help/interface/main_menu/file_menu).\n- **cache** stores cache files.\n- **file\\_preview** contains _.png_ images depicting recently used scenes (these images are seen on the splash screen under the **Recent Files** tab).\n- **logs** contain program log in the form of a text file.\n\nNote\n\nIf these files are deleted, all user settings will be reset (missing files are recreated on starting up the program, but with default settings).\n\n## Resources\n\nResources used by the software, such as scripts or shaders, are stored in the main Cascadeur directory, in the _Resouces_ folder:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2022/04/26/681ccf11453b91007563947040ba18d6.png)\n\nThis folder, in turn, includes several subfolders:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2022/04/26/e42974693938c073cd676a1406230faf.png)\n\n- **autorig\\_templates** is used for the [Quick Rigging Tool](https://cascadeur.com/help/rig/rig_mode/quick_rigging_tool).\n- **scripts** is the default folder for storing [Python scripts](https://cascadeur.com/help/tools/animation_tools/python_scripting_in_cascadeur).\n- **shaders** contains shaders used by the software.\n\nFinally, the **settings.ini** file contains the _ScriptsDir_ parameter which sets the folder for storing Python scripts.\n\nBy default, its value is empty; this means that the aforementioned _scripts_ folder is used.\n\nIf you'd like to use a different folder, set a custom value for this parameter.\n\n## Crash Dumps\n\nThe location of Cascadeur crash dumps depends on your system settings.\n\nBy default, the following directory is used:\n\n- **C:\\\\Users\\\\<user\\_name>\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\CrashDumps**\n\nIf you are using **Windows**, and crash dumps are not generated, you'll need to enable them manually.\n\nTo do this, open Windows Power Shell and run the following commands:\n\n_New-Item -Path \"HKLM:\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\Windows Error Reporting\" -Name \"LocalDumps\"_\n\n_New-ItemProperty -Path \"HKLM:\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\Windows Error Reporting\\\\LocalDumps\" -Name \"DumpFolder\" -Value \"%LOCALAPPDATA%\\\\CrashDumps\" -PropertyType \"ExpandString\"_\n\nThe commands should be executed as an Administrator.\n\n## See Also\n\n[Installation](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/68)\n\nWas this article useful to you?\n\n[Yes](https://cascadeur.com/help/rest/add-mark \"Yes\")\n\n14\n\n[No](https://cascadeur.com/help/rest/add-mark \"No\")\n\n2\n\nreCAPTCHA\n\nRecaptcha requires verification.\n\n[Privacy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) \\- [Terms](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/)\n\nprotected by **reCAPTCHA**\n\n[Privacy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) \\- [Terms](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/)",

Its purpose is to help you to translate your existing Maya experience into Cascadeur.\n\n# The Basics\n\nCascadeur is **not** a general-purpose 3D solution. You cannot create 3D models, nor can you skin it to joints/bones. Characters should be prepared for animation beforehand, in other programs.\n\nAnimation in Cascadeur is created in the same manner as it is in Maya. You only need to create [**keyframes**](https://cascadeur.com/help/keyframes) and set character poses for them, and the software will do the rest.\n\nHowever, there are some differences:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| #### **Maya** | #### **Cascadeur** |\n| You need to set the pose first, then you can add a keyframe | You need to add a keyframe and then set a pose for it |\n| Keyframes can be set separately for translation, rotation etc. | A keyframe always contains every motion parameter |\n\nCharacter poses and positions in Cascadeur are defined by keyframes.\n\nBecause of this, at least _one_ keyframe is always present in the scene.\n\nEvery frame in Cascadeur, including non-key ones, stores animation data. This means that regular frames can be moved, copied etc., much like keyframes.\n\nBy default, all keyframes in Cascadeur are placed on the same [**Animation Track**](https://cascadeur.com/help/animation_tracks) and thus contain animation data for **every** scene object. If you need to animate only some of the scene objects, - or a specific part of your character - create a separate track for this part and place keyframes on that track.\n\nThe timeline in Cascadeur is discreet. It always includes an integer number of frames, and there’s no way to place keyframes in the subframe space.\n\nHowever, you still have full control over animation and can stretch, retime and alter it in other ways.\n\n[**Graph Editor**](https://cascadeur.com/help/tools/animation_tools/graph_editor) is present in Cascadeur. However, the standard Cascadeur control rig isn’t designed to be controlled via Graph Editor as it has no exposed Euler transforms (translation/rotation/scale).\n\nYou can attempt to control the rig via Point Controllers with parameters such as Swing, Twist, Vector Length, and IK Direction. However, compared to the standard Graph Editor usage, you will probably find such an approach cumbersome and unappealing.\n\nInstead, the Cascadeur users are encouraged to refine their animation using the tools for tracking and editing the animation directly in the Viewport. These include:\n\n- [Frame ghosts](https://cascadeur.com/help/ghosts)\n- [Trajectory editing](https://cascadeur.com/help/trajectories)\n- [Filters](https://cascadeur.com/help/filters) for fixing animation errors\n- Tools for [mirroring poses](https://cascadeur.com/help/mirror_tools)\n\n...and more.\n\nAnother feature of Cascadeur is its [**Physics Tools**](https://cascadeur.com/help/physics_tools). This set of instruments can be used for easily creating physically accurate motions, as well as for improving the quality of the existing animations.\n\n# Interface\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2021/01/21/ca194a36dd0df02f87b7b7218f92819e.png)\n\n_User interface in Maya_\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/02/20/bb80471d12f3c86338425acc4248d700.png)\n\n_User interface in Cascadeur_\n\n**1** \\- Viewport/View Panel\n\n**2** \\- Timeline/Time Slider\n\n**3** \\- Toolbar/Menu Sets\n\n**4** \\- Object settings\n\n# Quick Glossary\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| #### **Maya** | #### **Cascadeur** |\n| Joint | Joint |\n| View panel | Viewport |\n| Menu Sets | Toolbar |\n| Time Slider / Time Editor | Timeline |\n| Interpolation | Interpolation |\n| Menus | Main Menu |\n\n# Controls\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| #### **Action** | #### **Maya** | #### **Cascadeur** |\n| **Camera Actions** |\n| Rotate Camera | Alt + LMB | Alt + LMB |\n| Zoom Camera | Alt + RMB | Alt + RMB |\n| Pan Camera | Alt + Mouse Wheel | Alt + Mouse Wheel |\n| **Selecting Objects** |\n| Select an object | LMB | LMB |\n| Border Select | Hold LMB and drag | Hold LMB and drag |\n| **Manipulators** |\n| Translate an object | W | W |\n| Rotate an object | E | E |\n| Hide an object | Ctrl + H | V |\n| Focus on an object | F | T |\n| **Frames and Animation** |\n| Add Keyframe | S | F |\n\n# Example\n\nCascadeur to Autodesk Maya \\| Bridge Plugin Workflow Tutorial - YouTube\n\n[Photo image of Cascadeur — Reinventing Animation](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwF6yYbIFJmB5ynAkzq9Psg?embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fcascadeur.com%2F)\n\nCascadeur — Reinventing Animation\n\n64.4K subscribers\n\n[Cascadeur to Autodesk Maya \\| Bridge Plugin Workflow Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiTGzay7Xto)\n\nCascadeur — Reinventing Animation\n\nSearch\n\nWatch later\n\nShare\n\nCopy link\n\nInfo\n\nShopping\n\nTap to unmute\n\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\n\nMore videos\n\n## More videos\n\nYou're signed out\n\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

By default, the **Y** axis is selected.\n\n**Adjust axis system on import**\n\nIf this option is enabled, Cascadeur converts the coordinate system when a 3D model is imported to the scene: if the model has the **Z** axis pointed upward, the system is changed so the **Y** axis would be up.\n\nThere are three possible options for this parameter:\n\n● **Off** means it is ignored and doesn’t affect anything.\n\n● If it is set to **Root**, the axes are adjusted on the basis of the root object, i.e. the object with the highest position in the hierarchy.\n\n● And if it is set to **Deep**, the root object is ignored, and the next object in the hierarchy is used instead. This can be used when, for example, when imported scenes display incorrect rotation.\n\nRoot is the default value.\n\n**Triangulate on import**\n\nIf this is enabled, the imported model is triangulated: every polygon with more than 3 vertices is divided into a set of triangles.\n\nDisabled by default.\n\n**Fbx compatibility version**\n\nThe version of the FBX format used for export.\n\nThe default version is **2020**.\n\n**Change start frame**\n\nIf this option is enabled, you can specify the first frame of the imported animation. This can be used, for example, when the initial frames are empty (and thus not needed), or when you have multiple animations combined into one sequence.\n\nIf it is left unchecked, the animation is imported starting with frame **0**.\n\nDisabled by default.\n\n**Open first take**\n\nIf this option is enabled, the first _take_ (animation clip) is applied when the file is imported to the scene (if the file has multiple takes).\n\nIf it is disabled, you’ll get a list of all takes in the file and can manually select one of them.\n\nDisabled by default.\n\n**Leave dialog open**\n\nIf this is enabled, the import window is left open after the file is imported to the scene. Otherwise, it is closed.\n\nDisabled by default.\n\nOnce you’ve finished setting the import options, click the Import button and choose the file you’d like to add into the scene:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2025/01/24/c391dbd456f50862e43e65396df3d86a.png)\n\n# Import Textures\n\nWarning\n\nBy default, the texture tool is **disabled** on the Toolbar.\n\nTo make it accessible, open the [**Settings Window**](https://cascadeur.com/help/interface/main_menu/settings_window) and enable the tool in the **Toolbar Visible** section.\n\nMenu options, however, are always available.\n\nTo add a texture to a model:\n\n**1.** Switch to the **Mesh Mode**.\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/02/20/b0b099ccbd7f1397bb2f6db7f4f3d6ba.png)\n\n**2.** In the **Viewport**, select a mesh\n\n**3.** Click the **Bind texture** button:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/02/20/912fd7f4fd4c34eb165e42c14544365b.png)\n\n...or select **Bind texture** from the [**View** menu](https://cascadeur.com/help/interface/main_menu/view_menu).\n\n**4.** Select the image file containing the texture.\n\n**Png**, **bmp**, **tga** and **jpeg** image formats are supported.\n\nAfter this, the texture should appear on the model.\n\nTo remove a texture from a model:\n\n**1.** Select the mesh.\n\n**2.** Click the **Unbind texture** button\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/02/20/d587fa85ddeb885dbd02151ed927873a.png)\n\n...or select **Unbind Texture** from the **View** menu.\n\nAfter this, the texture should be removed from the model.\n\n# Animated Textures\n\nYou can also import animated textures. There are two ways to do this:\n\nFirst, you can import a video file as a texture.\n\nTo do this:\n\n**1.** Select **File → Import → Reference video**.\n\n**2.** Select a video file.\n\nCurrently, only the **.mp4** files are supported.\n\nAfter this, a plane containing the video should appear in the scene.\n\nThis option is only intended for setting up animated references. It won't work with character models.\n\nSo if you'd like to apply an animated texture to a character, you should follow a different set of steps:\n\n**1.** Prepare a sequence of images named something like this:\n\n**tex\\_000.png**, **tex\\_001.png**, **tex\\_002**.png and so on.\n\n**2.** In Cascadeur, switch to the **Mesh Mode**.\n\n**3.** Select a mesh.\n\n**4.** Click the **Bind texture** button.\n\n**5.** Select every file you want to use for your animated texture.\n\nAfter this, the texture should be applied to the model. One file of the sequence is equal to one frame of animation\n\n# Common Problems\n\n**Incorrect Scale**\n\nIf a model is imported with an incorrect scale, this can be fixed in two ways:\n\nYou can scale the model manually, using the **Scale** manipulator\n\nIf the model is skinned to a skeleton, you can scale either the first object in the model's whole hierarchy (i.e. an Armature) or the first joint in the model's skeleton hierarchy (i.e. a 'root' joint).\n\nIf the model consists of just the mesh, you can scale the mesh object.Alternatively, you can change the selected object's **Local Scale** value, which can be accessed in the **Object properties** window, in the **Transform** behavior.\n\n**Error in pasting animation or timeline data**\n\nMake sure that your imported animation and the model in the scene have the same skeleton hierarchy (the set of joints).\n\nThe ' **Animation**', ' **Animation to selected frames**' and ' **Animation to selected objects**' presets import and apply animation data to the exact skeleton hierarchies present in the current scene and the animation file.\n\nThe animation may fail to import if the scene skeleton hierarchy’s joint order or naming scheme is significantly different.\n\nIf the skeleton in the animation file has the same naming scheme, but different proportions, the animation may get imported incorrectly.\n\nThe animation import can fail if the root objects (the first object in the skeleton hierarchy) in the scene and the animation file have different names, even though the rest of the joints are exactly the same. In that case, try selecting just the actual joint hierarchy of your character model and using the ' **Animation to selected objects**' preset.\n\nIf the animation import continues to fail, import the animation data with the ' **Scene**' preset into the current or new Cascadeur scene and compare the source and the target skeleton hierarchies. If their joint order, naming scheme or proportions are noticeably different, you may need to use the [**Retargeting**](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/219) tool to transfer animation between two different skeleton hierarchies.\n\n**Incorrect Import from Unreal Engine**\n\nIf you are experiencing problems trying to import animation from Unreal Engine to Cascadeur, please consult [**this page**](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/80).\n\n## See Also\n\n[Export FBX/DAE](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/76)\n\n[Import Animation from Unreal Engine](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/80)\n\n[Import from Blender](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/93)\n\nWas this article useful to you?\n\n[Yes](https://cascadeur.com/help/rest/add-mark \"Yes\")\n\n13\n\n[No](https://cascadeur.com/help/rest/add-mark \"No\")\n\n18\n\nreCAPTCHA\n\nRecaptcha requires verification.\n\n[Privacy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) \\- [Terms](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/)\n\nprotected by **reCAPTCHA**\n\n[Privacy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) \\- [Terms](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/)",

If you rely on third-party extensions, your methods of export may be different.\n\n# Export Formats and Settings\n\nFor import, you can use either FBX or Collada files.\n\nIt is recommended to use FBX format, as it is better supported by Cascadeur and less likely to cause problems during import. However, in rare cases these problems do occur, using Collada might help solving them.\n\nFor FBX export, use the default settings with minor alterations:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2022/03/01/c80d0d4f78c5407dcdd116f1f8586c2c.png)\n\n**1.** **Forward** should be set to **-Z Forward**.\n\n**2\\. Up** should be set to **Y Up**.\n\nThis is required because Blender and Cascadeur have slightly different coordinate systems: in Blender, the Z axis is the one facing up, while in Cascadeur, it is Y.\n\nWith these settings, your character should work in Cascadeur without issues.\n\n### Importing Sample Scenes\n\nIf you are importing animation made with [sample scenes](https://cascadeur.com/help/getting_started/scenes#start_sample_scenes) included in Cascadeur, you'll also need to enable the **Automatic Bone Orientation** parameter:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2022/03/15/52ccc00c73eb71083ca3992a1f971727.png)\n\nWithout it, the [joints](https://cascadeur.com/help/rig/rig_structure/rig_elements/joints) in the character's skeleton won't be properly aligned:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2022/03/15/de52b7be333288c23935977982ebaad3.png)\n\n_The same animation with **Automatic Bone Orientation** disabled (left) and enabled (right)._\n\n_Importing animation with default settings causes issues. Enabling Automatic Bone Orientation fixes these issues._\n\nThis issue is native to Blender. It only applies to sample scenes, custom characters should work without issues.\n\n# Exceptions\n\nSometimes you might encounter models that work fine when exported to Cascadeur, but display issues when brought back to Blender.\n\nThis is caused by the incorrect scale of the top object in the joint hierarchy, which in turn happens because of the way Blender handles FBX export, namely object scaling:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/02/20/c5b66b20e474277d46e2e41b2dff537e.png)\n\n_If the top object in the Joint hierarchy has its **Local scale** parameters set to **100** (instead of **1.0**),_\n\n_exporting this character back to Blender will lead to the issue shown above._\n\nThis issue too is native to Blender and arises due to the way it handles FBX file format.\n\nWhat to do about it should depend on your goals:\n\n-If you only need animation (to render it, for example), the issues with the joints can be ignored.\n\n-If you need your character to have a properly functioning skeleton, the best option is to use alternative importing methods such as third-party add-ons.\n\nYou can also try the following experimental method of exporting your character from Blender with the correct scale:\n\nNote\n\nBefore attempting this method, we recommend exporting the “original” model, without any modifications that come next. Later, the “original” pose’s joint translations can be copied to the “corrected” model.\n\n**1.** Select your character’s Armature object in the Viewport or the Outliner window (in the top right corner).\n\n**2.** Bring up the Sidebar (press N key) and switch to the Item tab.\n\n**3.** (Optional) If the Armature has any of its Location and Rotation values set to non-zero, select them and set them to zero. If the Armature itself has a Scale value that’s not 1.1.1, press Ctrl+A and click “Scale”.\n\n**4.** Go into Pose mode (Ctrl+Tab or change the mode in the top left corner)\n\n**5.** In the Outliner window, find and select your character’s root bone (the child of the Armature object).\n\n**6.** (Optional) If the Timeline contains keyframes, select and delete them with the Delete key.\n\n**7.** In the Item tab, find the Scale input fields and set them all to 100. If the Armature has multiple root bones, select and scale them up too.\n\nNote\n\nIf your rig has IK/FK controls for arms and legs, set all of them to FK before you attempt to scale the root bone(s).\n\n**8.** Switch back to the Object mode (Ctrl+Tab)\n\n**9.** Select the character mesh. If your character has a lot of meshes, you can use the “Select -> Select All by Type -> Mesh” command in the top left corner of the Viewport.\n\n**10.** Press Alt+P and select “Clear and Keep Transformation” in the appeared menu\n\n**11.** Select the character mesh in the Viewport or the Outliner window. In the Modifiers tab (wrench icon to the left of the Properties window in the bottom right corner), click on the Armature modifier, and with the cursor standing on top of it, press Ctrl+A to apply the modifier. Repeat this step for each other mesh belonging to your character\n\n**12.** Select the Armature and go to the Pose mode again (Ctrl+Tab).\n\n**13.** Select the root bone. Select “Pose -> Apply -> Apply Pose as Rest Pose”. That should reset the scale of the selected root bone from 100 back to 1. If your character has multiple root bones, repeat this step for each one too.\n\n**14.** Switch back to the Object mode (Ctrl+Tab).\n\n**15.** Select the character mesh, then select the Armature with the held-down Shift key. Press Ctrl+P and select “Armature Deform” in the appeared menu. Repeat this step for all other character meshes belonging to your character. Alternatively, you can first select all character meshes with the held-down Shift key and then select the Armature last\n\n**16.** In the Scene tab (“cone with a bubble” icon to the left of the Properties window in the bottom right corner), select the Units tab and change the Units Scale value to 0.01.\n\n**17.** Export your corrected character model (File -> Export -> FBX) with the following changes to the standard export settings:\n\n\\- In Object Types, select Armature and Mesh\n\n\\- In the Transform tab, set Forward to “-Z Forward” and Up to “Y Up”\n\n\\- In the Armature tab, turn off the “Add Leaf Bones” setting\n\n\\- Turn off the “Bake animation” setting\n\nIf the pose of the “corrected” model has been twisted after export and you have previously exported the “original” model, you can go through the following steps:\n\n**1.** Import the “corrected” model into the scene. Create a second new scene, then import the “original” model into it.\n\n**2.** In the Outliner window, right-click on the Armature and click the “Select branch” - this will select the Armature and all of its child objects.\n\n**3.** Copy (Ctrl+C) the transforms of the selected objects in Global mode (G/L button in the top left corner).\n\n**4.** Switch to the scene with the “corrected” model and repeat the step 2.\n\n**5.** Paste (Ctrl+V) the transforms to the selected objects in Global mode.\n\nWhen you import the “corrected” model back to Blender, its Armature’s scale will be set to 0.01.\n\nTo set the Armature’s scale to 1:\n\n**1.** Select the Armature\n\n**2.** Press Ctrl+A and select “Scale”\n\n# Example\n\nHow to import from Blender to Cascadeur and backward - YouTube\n\n[Photo image of Cascadeur — Reinventing Animation](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwF6yYbIFJmB5ynAkzq9Psg?embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fcascadeur.com%2F)\n\nCascadeur — Reinventing Animation\n\n64.4K subscribers\n\n[How to import from Blender to Cascadeur and backward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HBIWkUC-7o)\n\nCascadeur — Reinventing Animation\n\nSearch\n\nWatch later\n\nShare\n\nCopy link\n\nInfo\n\nShopping\n\nTap to unmute\n\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\n\nMore videos\n\n## More videos\n\nYou're signed out\n\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

Alternatively, you can use the foot’s Pose Controls to adjust its rotation using the expression sliders.\n\nAfter you’re done with one foot, mirror the other foot’s Rotation values accordingly.\n\nThen, in the Scene tab, select the Hip joint and adjust its Y Translate value to make the character stand above the ground plane.\n\n## Setting up the correct export settings\n\nThere are some specific export settings that you need to take notice of:\n\n**Merge Followers (into Target)** \\- an important setting that **has to be turned on**. If it’s turned off, the exported figure will contain multiple copies of the base skeleton hierarchy, each one generated for every character and clothing mesh. Turning it on parents each character and clothing mesh to the base skeleton hierarchy.\n\n**Include Figures - has to be turned on**. If not turned off, the exported file will not contain the character figure.\n\n**Embed Textures (Binary Only)** \\- recommended to be **turned off**. As of version 2023.2, Cascadeur is unable to utilize the textures embedded into the imported FBX. Because of that, texture embedding can be turned off for the sake of reducing the file size.\n\n**Collect Textures** \\- recommended to be **turned off**. The body mesh exported from Daz has separate textures for different body parts (main body, head, teeth, etc). As of version 2023.2, Cascadeur isn’t able to utilize these textures, because it requires the differently textured body parts to be separate mesh objects.\n\n**Include Animation** \\- optional. This setting has to be turned on only if your scene has the character animated. If the character is standing in a base pose, you can turn this setting off.\n\n![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/KDl61uIdnmyVeLAwtSeHRzmvZ3Npj5wshmdvNkF7XW84Siv0y2rwm1h2jnxi2Slgo_3XeyoD-DaNzbzOcStGvgmNuMnmzs-hbePatVuUWDJhFur4Yfb16mTsVVKeE65oXcVN7Uy-GL-m2PDMt2cI8xQ)\n\n_Recommended export settings for the FBX format._\n\n![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/yqhaVnDapECmbS4nqT9fOlnCiBWLzY9EoQJRNVyUngu_IUq-0ZWsKGwS7DbO9qVjxmEJVzcFXlQsgThUxVMeLD8ht87eBHirlLxPZJwzEmqCpanBxeFPWOwp6J8nVjKKwUdHfzPzyS0ZMOIKDjt4LbU)\n\n_Recommended export settings for the Collada format._\n\n## Model Import\n\nImport the model to Cascadeur by using the command at **File -> Import Fbx/Dae -> Scene.**\n\n![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/08SPo6GcFL7f9Cuucvdm4kzuyFgT61o6o6YZgyUSKHi32baJr9jFNoGHwCjAe7UBvE6vB_QUp76ypsX0iWq42Y5oppI5075T1wh7x2YtMwNV83xtbdn4a3AbGZmqatYTTJW2E6mBjpX94GBHl58-AxU)\n\n_Example of an imported character model._\n\n## Rigging\n\nNow you need to create a rig for your model.\n\nThe base of the rig can be created using [**Quick Rigging Tool**](https://cascadeur.com/help/quick_rigging_tool). Cascadeur has the QuickRig templates for the models that are compatible with the **Genesis8** and **Genesis9** skeletons.\n\nWarning\n\nIf your model is not compatible with the Genesis8 or Genesis9 skeletons, you would have to either fill in the fields in the Quick Rigging Tool yourself or create a rig manually.\n\nPlease note that the Quick Rigging Tool cannot properly work with [additional objects](https://cascadeur.com/help/secondary_elements). If your character includes complex hair or clothing meshes, you’ll have to rig them manually.\n\nIt is recommended to then use the regular [**Rigging Tool**](https://cascadeur.com/help/rigging_tool) for making refinements to the prototype rig, such as adjusting the size of the rigid bodies, adding more controllers to the base rig, and more. As usual, your goal is to create sets of [**Prototype objects**](https://cascadeur.com/help/prototype_objects) for the joints associated with your character. However, you don’t have to rig every joint.\n\nFor example:\n\n![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nThe Standard Daz Studio skeleton starts with a root joint. It is sometimes used for moving the character as a whole, but for Cascadeur rig, it is not necessary. We recommend ignoring it and starting rigging from the next joint in the hierarchy (named **Hip**).\n\nNote\n\nIt is highly recommended to add a control rig to the Daz character standing in their natural A-pose. Otherwise, you may have problems with using the \"Export to Daz\" and \"Go to T-pose\" commands.\n\n#### **Joints**\n\nCharacter skeleton in Daz is structured similarly to the one used by standard Cascadeur models, but its structure is a bit more complex, and some of the joint names are different.\n\nThe following tables list the main joints in the Cascadeur skeleton and their counterparts in Daz Genesis8 skeleton.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Cascadeur** | **Daz Studio** |\n| pelvis | hip |\n| stomach | abdomenLower |\n| chest | chestLower |\n| neck | neckLower |\n| head | head |\n| clavicle\\_r | rCollar |\n| arm\\_r | rShldrBend |\n| forearm\\_r | rForearmBend |\n| hand\\_r | rHand |\n| thigh\\_r | rThighBend |\n| calf\\_r | rShin |\n| foot\\_r | rFoot |\n| toe\\_r | rToe |\n\nIf a joint has two or more counterparts in the Daz Studio skeleton, we recommend to rig all of these joints with one set of prototypes. See [**Rigging Complex Skeletons**](https://cascadeur.com/help/rigging_complex_skeletons).\n\n#### **Additional Meshes**\n\nModels in Daz are often made up of several 3d meshes: one for the character's body and a few others for the hair, clothes, and accessories. These additional objects have their own sets of joints.\n\nSome of the more complex hair meshes have additional joint sets even when you enable the settings described above.\n\nFor them to work properly, you’ll need to parent them to the head joint(s):\n\n**1.** Select the joint to which the mesh itself is attached.\n\nUsually, it is the joint on the end of the chain.\n\n**2.** Enable **Only box controller** on the **Rigging Tool** panel.\n\n**3.** Create a box controller for the selected joint.\n\n**4.** Select the newly created box controller.\n\n**5.** In the **Outliner**, drag it on top of the other box controller: the one for the main head joint.\n\nNow, the box controller, and with it, the hair mesh, is parented to the head of the character and can be animated with it.\n\nFor the spine, we recommend creating about **three** Rigid Bodies. Further increasing their number might overcomplicate the rig.\n\n#### **Facial controls**\n\nAt the moment, Cascadeur does not support morphs and doesn't have the tools for creating the facial rig. Moreover, the \"Export to DAZ\" script that's used for correctly exporting the animation made in Cascadeur to DAZ, doesn't export the animation on facial joints.\n\nBut if you really need to, you can create rig elements for them.\n\n![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nIt is not recommended to create Rigid Bodies for these small joints (doing so will needlessly increase the complexity of the rig). A better option is to rig them using only [**Box Controllers**](https://cascadeur.com/help/box_controllers).\n\nSee [**Secondary Elements**](https://cascadeur.com/help/secondary_elements) to learn how to do this.\n\n#### **Finalizing the Rig**\n\nOnce everything is set, click **Generate rig**:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/02/20/36e21c90825a9fbc5141fe596fd62f0c.png)\n\nThen wait a bit, and your character should be fully rigged and ready for animation.\n\n## [Export to Daz Studio](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/192)\n\nOnce you’ve finished animating your model, you’ll probably want to send it back to Daz Studio for rendering.\n\nTo learn how this can be done, see the [dedicated page](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/192).\n\n## See Also\n\n[Import FBX/DAE](https://cascadeur.com/help/import_fbxdae)\n\n[Rig](https://cascadeur.com/help/rig)\n\nWas this article useful to you?\n\n[Yes](https://cascadeur.com/help/rest/add-mark \"Yes\")\n\n10\n\n[No](https://cascadeur.com/help/rest/add-mark \"No\")\n\n2\n\nreCAPTCHA\n\nRecaptcha requires verification.\n\n[Privacy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) \\- [Terms](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/)\n\nprotected by **reCAPTCHA**\n\n[Privacy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) \\- [Terms](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/)",

Either should work fine.\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2021/05/21/518a3bf30c13597c37660e5b3f5d36d4.png)\n\nAfter this, import the model to Cascadeur.\n\nTo do this, select either **Import FBX/DAE → Scene** or **Import FBX/DAE → Model** from the [**File** menu](https://cascadeur.com/help/file_menu).\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/04/10/326d41ccc31e3d86f36a00f76f2c0293.png)\n\nYou should end up with something like this.\n\n### Preparing the Arms\n\nBy default, character arms in Mixamo skeleton form a straight line:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/04/10/37837e9346649b98751c901fd64ffa58.png)\n\nThis might lead to incorrect bending in the finalized rig (see [here](https://cascadeur.com/help/hinge_connections) to learn more about it).\n\nTo prevent this from happening, you’ll need to manually fold the limbs before rigging:\n\n**1.** Switch to the [**Joint Mode**](https://cascadeur.com/help/edit_modes).\n\n**2.** Select the joints after the elbow.\n\n**3.** Go to the [**Scene Settings**](https://cascadeur.com/help/scene_settings) panel.\n\n**4.** On the **Manipulators** tab, enable the **Fix rotation step** parameter:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/04/10/33793a25193ccb6a3c77c1060c33042e.png)\n\n**5.** Set the value for Fix angle ( **5**, for example).\n\n**6.** On the **Toolbar**, set the **Local Mode** for the manipulators:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/04/10/c3a5aba033370ada32d6594fb8691da6.png)\n\n**7.** Use [**Rotate**](https://cascadeur.com/help/manipulators#rig_rotate_manipulator) manipulator to bend the arm.\n\n**8.** Do the same for the other arm.\n\nAfter this, everything should be ready for rigging.\n\n# Rigging\n\nThe base of the rig can be created using [**Quick Rigging Tool**](https://cascadeur.com/help/quick_rigging_tool).\n\nHowever, it is recommended to then use the regular [**Rigging Tool**](https://cascadeur.com/help/rigging_tool) for making refinements to the prototype rig.\n\nAs usual, your goal is to create sets of [**Prototype objects**](https://cascadeur.com/help/prototype_objects) for the joints associated with your character.\n\n### Joints\n\nCharacter skeleton in Mixamo is structured similarly to the one used by standard Cascadeur models, but its structure is a bit more complex, and some of the joint names are different.\n\nThe following tables list the main joints in the Cascadeur skeleton and their counterparts in Mixamo skeleton.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Cascadeur** | **Mixamo** |\n| pelvis | mixamorig:Hips |\n| stomach | mixamorig:Spine |\n| chest | mixamorig:Spine2 |\n| neck | mixamorig:Neck |\n| head | mixamorig:Head |\n| clavicle\\_r | mixamorig:RightShoulder |\n| arm\\_r | mixamorig:RightArm |\n| forearm\\_r | mixamorig:RightForeArm |\n| hand\\_r | mixamorig:RightHand |\n| thigh\\_r | mixamorig:RightUpLeg |\n| calf\\_r | mixamorig:RightLeg |\n| foot\\_r | mixamorig:RightFoot |\n| toe\\_r | mixamorig:RightToeBase |\n\nIf a joint has two or more counterparts in the Mixamo skeleton, we recommend rigging all of these joints with one set of prototypes.

In the case one of them faces the opposite direction:\n\n**1.** Select the prototype [**Point Controller**](https://cascadeur.com/help/point_controllers) in the corresponding elbow.\n\n**2.** In the [**Outliner**](https://cascadeur.com/help/outliner), open the **Hinge settings** behavior tab.\n\n**3.** Disable **Direction controller is right**:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/04/10/4384122f6640df76569f2068d7213cde.png)\n\nAfter this both controllers will be facing the right direction:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/04/10/44446c7fa91c4d93c9b662db73001ea8.png)\n\n### Finalizing the Rig\n\nOnce everything is set, click **Generate rig**:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/02/20/d90cc0b762a3e814641a5982bde625d4.png)\n\nThen wait a bit, and your character should be fully rigged and ready for animation.\n\n# Animation\n\nTo add animation to a Mixamo character:\n\n**1.** Select **File → Import Fbx/Dae → Animation**:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/02/20/55b490736526d3cc4b18ff96b81d242b.png)\n\n**2.** Specify the file (in FBX or Collada format) containing the animation.\n\nAfter this, the animation should be imported and applied to the character.\n\nTo learn more about importing animation see [here](https://cascadeur.com/help/import_fbxdae#import_animations).\n\n# Example\n\nMixamo to Cascadeur - Using Custom Characters - YouTube\n\n[Photo image of Cascadeur — Reinventing Animation](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwF6yYbIFJmB5ynAkzq9Psg?embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fcascadeur.com%2F)\n\nCascadeur — Reinventing Animation\n\n64.4K subscribers\n\n[Mixamo to Cascadeur - Using Custom Characters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZHVubEDifk)\n\nCascadeur — Reinventing Animation\n\nSearch\n\nWatch later\n\nShare\n\nCopy link\n\nInfo\n\nShopping\n\nTap to unmute\n\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\n\nMore videos\n\n## More videos\n\nYou're signed out\n\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

To avoid possible inconsistencies, we recommend using one setting for both programs.\n\n• If you are planning to use 30 fps animation, set Frame Rate to 30 during export.\n\n• If you are planning to use 60 fps, set an empty Cascadeur scene to 60 fps before importing the model.\n\nOnce you have an FBX file, import it to Cascadeur.To do this, select either **Import FBX/DAE → Scene** or **Import FBX/DAE → Model** from the [**File** menu](https://cascadeur.com/help/file_menu).\n\nThe model should appear in the scene:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/02/27/cbda9eaadde5dbf5663ec6104239182e.png)\n\nHowever, to be able to properly animate the model in Cascadeur, you’ll need to create a rig for it.\n\n# Preparing For Rigging\n\nBy default, models from Character Creator have their limbs forming straight lines.\n\nRigging a model like this would lead to issues with [**Direction Controllers**](https://cascadeur.com/help/direction_controllers). So for the rig to work properly we need to give the limbs a slight bend:\n\n**1.** Switch to the **Joint Mode**.\n\n**2.** Go to the [**Scene settings** panel](https://cascadeur.com/help/scene_settings).\n\n**3.** On the [**Manipulators**](https://cascadeur.com/help/manipulators) tab, enable **Fix rotation step** and set the value to something like **5**:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/02/27/5fb21572a592beeb5eee639315824f33.png)\n\n**4.** Select a limb.\n\n**5.** Use the **Rotate** manipulator to bend it:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2021/12/08/7baea9c371156eb74a651cfa1569d792.gif)\n\nThis should be done for both arms and legs\n\n# Creating the Rig\n\nNow you can proceed to rig the character. The easiest way to do this is to use the [**Quick Rigging Tool**](https://cascadeur.com/help/quick_rigging_tool):\n\n**1.** Turn on the Rig Mode:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/02/27/610d197a951525efb00b76bbf209e388.png)\n\n**2.** The **Rigging Tools** window should appear:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/02/27/342584f3a12f01f228dd61a930b6432f.png)\n\n**3.** There, click the **Quick Rigging Tool** button:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/02/27/d2faaf10b633615adf67a714aa48d041.png)\n\nThe **Quick Rigging Tool** window will appear:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/02/27/b853e84cb2e605101b7b7ef15d605c84.png)\n\nIn this window, you’ll need to set an appropriate joint for every point/slot.\n\nSee the [**Quick Rigging Tool** page](https://cascadeur.com/help/quick_rigging_tool) to learn more about doing this.\n\nIf you are using one of the standard Character Creator models, joints will be assigned automatically. If you rig a more customized character, you’ll have to assign them manually.\n\nHowever, you don’t have to rig every joint. For example:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/02/27/44d1a781f6e48afb03e4a7554b725a42.png)\n\nThe Standard Character Creator skeleton starts with a **root joint**. Joints like these are sometimes used for moving the character as a whole, but for Cascadeur rig, they are not necessary. We recommend to ignore the root and start rigging from the next joint in the hierarchy (named **pelvis**).\n\n_**Warning**_\n\nBefore you start creating a rig for your character, make sure that the character’s feet touch the ground level. If this is not the case, you should manually position the character on the ground.\n\nWhen the feet don’t touch the ground in their default position, the AutoPosing feature won’t be able to handle them properly.\n\n# Joints\n\nThe structure of the Cascadeur rig is similar to that of the one in Character Creator, but there are some differences.\n\nThe following table lists the joints in the Cascadeur rig and their counterparts in the CC:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Cascadeur** | **Character Creator** |\n| pelvis | Hip |\n| stomach | Spine01 |\n| chest | Spine02 |\n| neck | NeckTwist01 |\n| head | Head |\n| clavicle\\_r | R\\_Clavicle |\n| arm\\_r | R\\_Upperarm |\n| forearm\\_r | R\\_Forearm |\n| hand\\_r | R\\_Hand |\n| thigh\\_r | R\\_Thigh |\n| calf\\_r | R\\_Calf |\n| foot\\_r | R\\_Foot |\n| toe\\_r | R\\_ToeBase |\n\nSkeletons in Character Creator are symmetrical. This means that you only need to rig the limbs on one side and then simply mirror them for the other.\n\nThis is not required, but can greatly speed up the rigging process.\n\nSee the [**Quick Rigging Tool** page](https://cascadeur.com/help/quick_rigging_tool) to learn more about limb mirroring.\n\nOnce you set all of the joints, click **Add rig elements**:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/02/27/e87a90075d6328603251ee0adb66e8ca.png)\n\nThen close the Quick Rigging Tool window. You should see the character model with sets of prototype objects attached:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/02/27/96eaa6a19ca6ccf2e99d6ec8ccf4868f.png)\n\nNow, the only thing left is to finalize the rig. To do this, click the **Generate rig** button at the bottom of the Rigging tools panel:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/02/27/13cbe08e1e74e2f3d1d76cb703450c35.png)\n\nThe end result should be something like this:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/02/27/d1d8baf487cbc8d98844afbf99e33c40.png)\n\nNow your character is properly riggen and can be used in Cascadeur.\n\n# Example\n\nAccuRIG to Cascadeur - How to Rig a Character - YouTube\n\n[Photo image of Cascadeur — Reinventing Animation](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwF6yYbIFJmB5ynAkzq9Psg?embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fcascadeur.com%2F)\n\nCascadeur — Reinventing Animation\n\n64.4K subscribers\n\n[AccuRIG to Cascadeur - How to Rig a Character](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6q2aqcy9j0)\n\nCascadeur — Reinventing Animation\n\nSearch\n\nWatch later\n\nShare\n\nCopy link\n\nInfo\n\nShopping\n\nTap to unmute\n\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\n\nMore videos\n\n## More videos\n\nYou're signed out\n\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

However, there are certain nuances you might encounter when you try to use such characters with Cascadeur.\n\nThis page describes the ways of dealing with these nuances.\n\n## Exporting MetaHuman Characters\n\nIf you’d like to animate MetaHuman characters in Cascadeur, you’ll first need to _export_ them.\n\nThe most convenient way to do this is by using **Quixel Bridge**.\n\n**1.** Open Quixel Bridge\n\nAt the moment using it is the only way to export MetaHuman characters.\n\nNote\n\nYou need the version of Quixel Bridge compatible with the preset you’re using. For example, if you are using a UE5 MetaHuman preset, use Bridge for UE5\n\n**2.** Open your character.\n\nCurrently, MetaHuman characters can only be exported to Maya and to Unreal Engine.\n\nIf your plan is to use your character(s) for creating animation, you’ll need to use the Maya export option.\n\n**3.** Open **Export Settings**:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/09/20/df662bc74fbaed3f00311065ecf11892.png)\n\n**4.** On the **Export Target** tab, select **Maya**:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/09/20/90b30ab2c3f6762e0b7e75514c4e4b78.png)\n\n**5.** Now go to the **Models** tab and select the level of detail you’d like to export:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/09/20/6c674ad9667624616efd4bb917994fb8.png)\n\nUsing **LOD0** is not recommended: it might include objects (such as hair strands) not currently supported by Cascadeur.\n\n**6.** On the same tab, set **MetaHumans** to **Source Asset**:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/09/20/d3dec6dec866d01ba5db759e574cd18e.png)\n\nNow, everything is set.\n\n**7.** Go back to the panel and click **Export**:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/09/20/4ece64197c630c4c26e2988980b32d24.png)\n\nYou should get a set of files compatible with Maya.\n\nYou can read more about it here:\n\n[https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/metahuman/exporting-metahumans-to-maya](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/metahuman/exporting-metahumans-to-maya)\n\nAfter you get the character to Maya, simply re-export the scene to FBX format and import the file to Cascadeur.\n\nAlternatively, you can try to export your MetaHuman characters directly from **Unreal Engine**.\n\nTo do this, you’ll need to manually export several assets that make up a MetaHuman character:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/09/20/412ee6be53bf9335985f0c5f14c39079.png)\n\n**1.** Right-click the asset file.\n\n**2.** Select **Asset Actions → Export…** from the menu:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/09/20/56fd9c31ed296574e6120b432a7f7138.png)\n\nYou should get an .fbx file containing the corresponding part of the character.\n\nYou'll need to repeat this procedure for every asset that make up the character\n\nMetaHuman characters include several parts: the skeleton and several meshes, with the exact list depending on the level of detail you are using.\n\n#### **Import and Rigging**\n\nOnce you have the assets exported, you can get them to a Cascadeur scene.\n\nWe recommend to start with importing the skeleton and then applying meshes to it.\n\nTo import the skeleton, use **File → Import Fbx/Dae → Scene**. You can import one of the exported skeleton meshes.\n\nThe problem with the meshes is that each exported skeleton mesh has a differently named root Transform object. Because of that, the skeleton hierarchies aren’t matching completely, and thus, when you use the **Add model to selected** preset to add the mesh to an existing skeleton hierarchy, a separate hierarchy would be imported instead.\n\nThis can be fixed by renaming the root Transform object already imported in the scene, to the name of the root Transform object of the skeleton mesh you want to import.\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2025/02/07/052f1132bf9194ed353b3a3b7c73343e.jpg)\n\n_Example of 2 skeleton meshes from the same Metahuman character._\n\n_Notice the difference between the names of the root Transform objects._\n\nFor each of the meshes:\n\n**1.** Import a second skeleton mesh with **Add Fbx/Dae → Scene**.\n\n**2.** Select the second skeleton mesh’s root Transform object.\n\n**3.** Copy its name in the **Object Properties** tab below.\n\n**4.** Undo the import by selecting **Undo** from the **Edit** menu (or by pressing **Ctrl** and **Z**).\n\n**5.** Rename the first skeleton mesh’s root Transform object with the copied name.\n\n**6.** Switch to the **Joint Mode**.\n\n**7.** Select the whole skeleton hierarchy.\n\n**8.** Select **Add Fbx/Dae → Add model to selected** from the **File** menu.\n\n**9.** Pick the same skeleton mesh file that you’ve previously imported.\n\n**10.** Repeat steps **1-9** until the whole character is assembled.\n\nAfter you do these steps for every part of the character, you should get a functioning 3D model.\n\nNow, you need to add a rig to it.\n\nThe MetaHuman skeleton is similar to the one used in the standard UK4 and UK5 models.\n\nYou can use the [**Quick Rigging Tool**](https://cascadeur.com/help/rig/rig_mode/quick_rigging_tool) to create the base of the rig.\n\nAfter the base is complete, however, you can use the regular [**Rigging Tools**](https://cascadeur.com/help/rig/rig_mode/rigging_tools) to make further adjustments - if you need them.\n\n## Applying Cascadeur Animations\n\nAnimations created in Cascadeur can be applied to MetaHuman characters.\n\nWhen you create animations to be used with MetaHuman characters, we’d recommend using models with similar structure: UE4 Mannequin for UE4 MetaHuman template, UE5 Manny/Quinn for UE5.\n\nOnce animation is complete, you’ll need to export it, so it could be applied to the character.\n\nRecommended settings:\n\n**FbxUpAxis** to **Z**\n\n**TypeFbxAscii** to **Off**\n\nBoth these settings are found in the [**Settings Window**](https://cascadeur.com/help/interface/main_menu/settings_window), under the APP category:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/09/20/bd5a4ed4b5bb8b8fb84bc81124a1492d.png)\n\nTo export animation:\n\n**1.** Open the **File** menu.\n\n**2.** Select **Export Fbx/Dae → Without Meshes**:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/09/20/0b1002a69e034ab38b77bdbd0b7b9c99.png)\n\n**3.** In the save file dialog, set the **FBX** format.\n\nWhat you’ll get is an .fbx file containing the character skeleton and animation associated with it. This file, you can import to the engine and use the animation with your character.\n\nHowever, the imported animation should be retargeted.\n\nThe nuances of retargeting animations for MetaHuman characters are described here:\n\n[https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/metahuman/retargeting-animations-to-a-metahuman-in-unreal-engine-5](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/metahuman/retargeting-animations-to-a-metahuman-in-unreal-engine-5)\n\n## Common Issues\n\nSometimes when you apply animations to a MetaHuman character, a distortion like this occurs:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/09/20/461c25ed41de0595d9a5f588aca7736d.png)\n\nThis can be fixed by altering skeleton settings:\n\n**1.** Open the skeleton.\n\n**2.** Go to the **Skeleton Tree** panel.\n\n**3.** Set **root** and **pelvis** to **Animation**.\n\n**4.** Set all other bones to **Skeleton**:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/09/20/8fe1f4ac3ac36f5b783a575f2c90701d.png)\n\n**5.** Save the skeleton.\n\nAfter this, animations should work without any problems.\n\nWas this article useful to you?\n\n[Yes](https://cascadeur.com/help/rest/add-mark \"Yes\")\n\n14\n\n[No](https://cascadeur.com/help/rest/add-mark \"No\")\n\n10\n\nreCAPTCHA\n\nRecaptcha requires verification.\n\n[Privacy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) \\- [Terms](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/)\n\nprotected by **reCAPTCHA**\n\n[Privacy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) \\- [Terms](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/)",

A scene can be saved to a _.casc_ file, and a previously saved scene can be restored from a file.\n\nScenes are primarily viewed through the [Viewport](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/10) window. You can open multiple scenes at the same time, with each one occupying a separate tab in the Viewport.\n\nTo learn about controlling the scene, see [**Main Controls**](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/74)\n\n## Creating a New Scene\n\nWorking on an animation project should start with creating a new scene. There are two ways to do this.\n\n**First**, you can click the **New Scene** button on the [splash screen](https://cascadeur.com/help/interface/splash_window) that appears when you run Cascadeur:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/02/27/cfcaf43c1261051325794c36b6c933ff.png)\n\n**Second**, you can select **New Scene** from the [**File** menu](https://cascadeur.com/help/interface/main_menu/file_menu):\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/02/27/d6a42d61aa0f474f9db7858ecf6f465c.png)\n\nEither way, this will create a new empty scene:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/02/27/71262c4727135302c92da42c4b8a6ec1.png)\n\n_A newly created scene in the Viewport window_\n\n## Opening an Existing Scene\n\nAlternatively, you can load a pre-existing scene to use it as a base for your work. As with creating a new file, this can be done in two ways:\n\n**First**, you can select **Open...** from the **File** menu:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/02/27/0d2d33945db0d510512aa4bec87f8efa.png)\n\nA standard Open File dialogue will appear. Use it to specify the file you need to open.\n\n**Second**, you can open a folder that contains the file you need in any file manager and double-click the name of the file:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2019/06/057799bb16c88b7765ebbd4fbb1854c6a9.jpg)\n\nEither way, the file you've chosen will be loaded to Cascadeur and shown in the **Viewport** window:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/02/27/6c523679fa0b59c7be32cd11a1b60bb4.png)\n\n_The **cube.casc** (included in the installation package) file opened in the program_\n\n## Scene Contents\n\nA scene can include the following types of objects:\n\n- Characters\n- Camera objects\n- Helper objects\n\n#### **Models and Characters**\n\nCascadeur works with _3d models_, or _meshes_: 3d objects that represent an object or a character.\n\nThese models can be animated on their own, but this method of animation is very limited. You’ll only be able to move and scale objects, but not to deform them - which is often necessary for more complex animations. Moreover, you won’t be able to use most of the functionality Cascadeur provides.\n\nBecause of this, a better way to animate 3d models is to use a skeleton.\n\nA skeleton is a set of [**Joints**](https://cascadeur.com/help/rig/rig_structure/rig_elements/joints) (bones) that is attached to the mesh and then used for controlling it. Each joint is linked to a part of the mesh, allowing you to move the character’s skeleton to position the character.\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/02/27/f880cd44e68c4cc6e2f96cea2be60308.png)\n\n_Character mesh (left) and character skeleton (right) as seen in Cascadeur viewport._\n\n3d models with skeletons attached are often referred to as _characters_.\n\nMeshes and joints are both brought to Cascadeur through the process of [import](https://cascadeur.com/help/getting_started/import_fbxdae).\n\nLinks between joints and meshes are created through _skinning_.\n\nSkinning establishes the influence joints have on the parts of the mesh.\n\nThe image below shows a character in Blender (a popular 3d software). Here, you can see several of the joints with the amount of influence each one of them has on the parts of the mesh:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2022/03/24/e28a4e1b32c70f8d91073585e419f7ea.gif)\n\n_Red color means maximum influence, blue means no influence._\n\nThese values are used to deform the mesh when joints move:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2022/03/24/5ae47018710100898bf98687a92ef802.gif)\n\n_A skinned mesh would deform in accordance to the skeleton attached to it._\n\nCurrently, skinning **cannot** be done in Cascadeur. You need to import your models with their meshes already skinned to the joints. This can be done in most of the 3d software solutions.\n\nWhen you don’t have access to such software, you might consider online solutions such as [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/). Using them, you can upload a 3d model and attach it to a standard humanoid skeleton; skinning values will be generated automatically.\n\nThis approach will obviously only work with human-shaped characters, but if your characters are indeed human-shaped, this might be enough.\n\nIf you are not sure if you character already has skinning, there’s an easy way to find out:\n\n**1.** Switch to the [**Joint Mode**](https://cascadeur.com/help/getting_started/edit_modes):\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/02/27/a3d38abd8e4709657ed7c7e2bd095343.png)\n\n**2.** Select one (or several) of the joints.\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/02/27/d42efb112042f2f31e622235d90bcaf3.png)\n\n_Joints you’ve selected will be colored yellow in the Viewport window._\n\n**3.** Go to the **Mesh mode**:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/02/27/d4000019430dbe879c7e3dd4bd4d7cf9.png)\n\n**4.** Select the [**Rotate** manipulator](https://cascadeur.com/help/tools/animation_tools/manipulators#rig_rotate_manipulator):\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/02/27/e399a822619432b5d747a6ec9c1be341.png)\n\n**5.** Try to rotate the joint you’ve selected.\n\nIf the mesh moves after the joint, then it is already skinned to the skeleton.\n\nIf it doesn’t, there is either no skinning data or something has gone wrong during import.\n\n#### **Camera Objects**\n\nIf you need to view your scene from a pre-defined angle, this can be achieved by adding a **Camera** object to the scene. To do this, select **Camera** from the **Objects** menu.\n\nAfter you created a new Camera, select it by clicking its name in the **Outliner** window at the right:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/02/27/26cc0c50d3e5e593f132d275182b29f1.png)\n\nNote\n\nA camera object is only visible when it is selected.\n\nCamera objects cannot be adjusted using general controls described above. The only way to change their positions and spatial orientation is by applying manipulators.\n\nTo see the scene through an additional camera, press the **Align to Camera** button in the Toolbar.\n\n#### **Helper Objects**\n\nThis type of objects is used for improving animation, creatig physically accurate motions and such.\n\nAvailable helper objects include:\n\n- [**Ghosts**](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/22)\n- [**Trajectories**](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/23)\n- [**Angular Momentum**](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/40) visualizer\n- [**Ballistic Curves**](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/42)\n\n## Sample Scenes\n\nCascadeur installation package includes several example files that you can use as templates or as means to learn about software's features. These examples are located in the **.../cascadeur/scenes** folder. Character models in these files are fully rigged and ready for animation.\n\n- **Backflip\\_animation.casc** \\- a complex animation of a character performing a backflip. Makes use of Cascadeur's physical tools such as [Ballistic Trajectory](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/42).\n- **Cascy.casc** - a scene with the standard Cascadeur character model.\n- **Cascy\\_sabers.casc** - a  scene with a standard character with two sabred attached.\n- **Cascy\\_sword.casc** - a scene with a standard character with a giant sword attached.\n- **Cube.casc** \\- a simple scene including one cube.\n- **Dracorex.casc** \\- a rigged model of a dinosaur.\n- **Dracorex\\_walk\\_cycle.casc** \\- the same model performing a walking animation.\n- **Move\\_AI.casc** \\- a sample model for [Move AI](https://www.move.ai/).\n- **MVN\\_Puppet.casc** \\- a sample model for the [Movella](https://www.movella.com/) motion capture solution.\n- **Rokoko.casc** \\- a sample model for the [Rokoko](https://www.rokoko.com/) motion capture system.\n- **Sabertooth.casc** \\- a model of a sabertooth cat.\n- **UE4\\_Mannequin.casc** \\- a scene with a standard Unreal Engine 4 character.\n- **UE4\\_Mannequin\\_Female.casc** \\- a scene with the same rig. but a different character model.\n- **UE5\\_Manny.casc** \\- a scene with a standard Unreal Engine 5 character.\n- **UE5\\_Quinn.casc** \\- a scene with another standard Unreal Engine 5 character.\n- **UEFN\\_Mannequin.casc** \\- a scene with a model for Unreal Editor for Fortnite.\n\n## Migrating Scenes\n\nThere are some incompatibilities between the closed Beta and the current Open Beta versions of Cascadeur. These incompatibilities prevent scenes from the older version to properly work in the newer one.\n\nSo if you want to use an outdated scene, you'll need to **migrate** it to the new version.\n\nSee [**Migrating Outdated Scenes**](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/100) to learn how to do it.\n\n## Scenes With Multiple Character\n\nSometimes you might need a scene with several characters in it. For this, there is a dedicated page: [**Scenes With Multiple Characters**](https://cascadeur.com/help/getting_started/scenes/scenes_with_multiple_characters).\n\nHowever, do keep in mind that incresing the number of characters also increases the computation power required to properly run the scene. If your machine struggles with a complex scene, you might consider using [**Scene Linking Tool**](https://cascadeur.com/help/tools/animation_tools/scene_linking_tool) instead of one scene with multiple characters.\n\n## See Also\n\n[Main Controls](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/74)\n\n[Edit Modes](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/53)\n\n[Rig Structure](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/17)\n\nWas this article useful to you?\n\n[Yes](https://cascadeur.com/help/rest/add-mark \"Yes\")\n\n11\n\n[No](https://cascadeur.com/help/rest/add-mark \"No\")\n\n0\n\nreCAPTCHA\n\nRecaptcha requires verification.\n\n[Privacy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) \\- [Terms](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/)\n\nprotected by **reCAPTCHA**\n\n[Privacy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) \\- [Terms](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/)",

This page describes how this can be achieved.\n\n# Getting Started\n\nStart with opening a scene containing one character:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/04/10/ef8ffbafcb9baa1e84cc2c7394f3b229.png)\n\nHere we are using the _Standard\\_model\\_male.casc_ file from the standard Cascadeur package as an example.\n\n# Importing Characters\n\nNow you can add the second character.\n\n**1.** Select **Import → Import Fbx/Dae** from the [**File**](https://cascadeur.com/help/file_menu) menu:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2025/02/17/e55a567dc1817a5605768040e517ca82.png)\n\n**2.** Select the _.casc_ file containing the second character.\n\nNow the second character should appear in the scene.\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2025/02/17/a87a90be534a4bafaa1ad1f3366d9b59.png)\n\nBut as you can see, the imported character appears at the center of the scene: the place already occupied by the first character.\n\nTo move a character:\n\n**3.** Switch to the [**Point Controller** Mode](https://cascadeur.com/help/edit_modes).\n\n**4.** Select every the character's [**Center of Mass**](https://cascadeur.com/help/tools/physics_tools/center_of_mass).\n\n**5.** Use the [**Translate** manipulator](https://cascadeur.com/help/manipulators#rig_translate_manipulator) to move the character.\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2025/02/17/e4cc4bc7ebf1b82ceaccc4bd8106b122.gif)\n\nRepeat these steps for every character you’d like to add to the scene.\n\n# Namespaces\n\nImported characters are automatically assigned namespaces: the first imported character gets _character\\_1_ namespace, the second is _character\\_2_ and so on.\n\nThis is done to avoid naming conflicts. In a Cascadeur scene, you can use one name for several objects without issues; however, if you try to export such a scene into FBX or Collada format, this will lead to conflicts.\n\nNote\n\nThese namespaces do not take into account the character or characters that are in the scene from the start.\n\nYou can manually change namespace for any odject. To do this:\n\n**1.** Select an object.\n\n**2.** Use the **Change namespace** option from the [**Commands** menu](https://cascadeur.com/help/interface/main_menu/commands_menu):\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/04/10/de0c6be7a9dd2d90ed330a9dbfd9be3b.png)\n\n**3.** Set the new namespace for the object you've selected.\n\nAnd this is all there is to know about setting up scenes with multiple characters.\n\n**However:** keep in mind that populating the scene with a large number of characters may cause slowdowns.\n\nIf your system is unable to process as many characters as you need, you might try to use [**Scene Linking Tool**](https://cascadeur.com/help/scene_linking_tool).\n\n# Example\n\nHow to Animate 2 Characters in Cascadeur \\| Contact Pair Animation - YouTube\n\n[Photo image of Cascadeur — Reinventing Animation](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwF6yYbIFJmB5ynAkzq9Psg?embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fcascadeur.com%2F)\n\nCascadeur — Reinventing Animation\n\n64.4K subscribers\n\n[How to Animate 2 Characters in Cascadeur \\| Contact Pair Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumcvLfNnDM)\n\nCascadeur — Reinventing Animation\n\nSearch\n\nWatch later\n\nShare\n\nCopy link\n\nInfo\n\nShopping\n\nTap to unmute\n\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\n\nMore videos\n\n## More videos\n\nYou're signed out\n\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

Each edit mode makes available for editing only some types of controllers, and each edit mode is better suited for a particular task. Using different modes for different purposes is necessary for fast and efficient work with character poses.\n\nEdit modes are selected by clicking buttons on the dedicated panel right below the [**Toolbar**](https://cascadeur.com/help/interface/toolbar):\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/03/01/1bab294bef3294694e76c8b06350bb5b.png)\n\n_Panel for selecting **Edit Modes** on the Toolbar_\n\n## Available Edit Modes\n\nThere is a total of seven edit modes:\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/03/01/9d0823c1cc45efcd239a0b825f10309d.png) | [![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/03/01/ae34ade5e88befcd6847ff900c775560.png)](https://cascadeur.com/help/autoposing) | [![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/03/01/de7c525afefd3378e4e82e5580bc291b.png)](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/18) |\n| **View Mode** only shows the model itself with no controllers. | [**AutoPosing**](https://cascadeur.com/help/autoposing) mode is used for automated pose generation | [**Point Controller**](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/18) mode is the main mode for editing poses |\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/03/01/126d093aa12ef643bdae4dbd760e79de.png)](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/19) | [![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/03/01/9b2da9b898cbab2374eee999829bbf1f.png)](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/20) | [![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/03/01/417643bc934e32e4e17fb68c888c45d4.png)](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/26) |\n| [**Box Controller**](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/19) mode is used for adjusting fine details such as fingers or cloth parts | [**Joint Mode**](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/20) shows character armature | **Mesh Mode** is used for working with [meshes](http://cascadeur.com/help/category/26) |\n| [![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/03/01/ab8757cd55772970f85dcc5f3ef636b7.png)](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/45) |  |  |\n| **Rigging view Mode** displays [**character rigs**](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/45) |  |  |\n\n## Customizing Edit Modes\n\nBy default, every edit mode has its own preset of elements available for editing. These presets, however, can be fully customized by using the **Visible** (which defines what types of objects are visible) and **Selectable** (defines object types available for editing) menus.\n\nTo access these menus, **right-click** the **Edit Mode** indicator below the Toolbar:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/03/01/7261fde5ff0883232b8aef101d3aabba.png)\n\n**Visible Menu**\n\nThis menu lists every object type that can be present in a scene:\n\nThese elements are:\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [Box Controllers](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/19) | [Center of Mass](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/39) | [Joints](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/20) |\n| [Point Controllers](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/18) | [Ballistic Trajectories](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/42) | [Shaded Meshes](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/26) |\n| [Edges](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/50) | [Object Trajectories](https://cascadeur.com/help/trajectories) | [Wireframe Meshes](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/26#meshes_wireframe) |\n| [AutoPosing Controllers](https://cascadeur.com/help/autoposing) | [Angular Momentums](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/40) | [Textures](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/26#mesh_mode_textures) |\n| [Rigid Bodies](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/25) | [Angular Momentum Ghosts](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/40#angmom_ghosts) | [Camera Objects](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/29#camera_objects) |\n| [Prototype Objects](https://cascadeur.com/help/prototype_objects) |\n\nBy checking items on this list you can enable rendering of corresponding object types in the [**Viewport** window](https://cascadeur.com/help/interface/viewport).\n\nThe menu also includes the **X-Ray** feature. When it is enabled, Prototype Objects are always visible, even if they are obscured by meshes and other objects. This feature is used on the rigging stage.\n\n#### **Selectable Menu**\n\nThis menu allows you to define which types of objects in the scene can be made selectable in the **Viewport**.\n\nIt contains the same list of objects as the **Visible** menu. Checking items on this list marks object types as _selectable_, i.e. ones that you can [select](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/54) in the Viewport.\n\n_**Note:** Even if an object is not marked as selectable, it can still be selected in the [**Outliner**](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/56) window._\n\nUsing these two menus allows you to completely change the appearance of the Viewport window and the set of objects to work with.\n\nAll changes made to the visible and selecteble lists can be reverted by selecting **Reset all to factory settings** from the [**Settings** menu](https://cascadeur.com/help/interface/main_menu/settings_menu).\n\n## See Also\n\n[Rig Structure](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/17)\n\n[Scenes](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/29)\n\n[Manipulators](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/27)\n\nWas this article useful to you?\n\n[Yes](https://cascadeur.com/help/rest/add-mark \"Yes\")\n\n6\n\n[No](https://cascadeur.com/help/rest/add-mark \"No\")\n\n3\n\nreCAPTCHA\n\nRecaptcha requires verification.\n\n[Privacy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) \\- [Terms](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/)\n\nprotected by **reCAPTCHA**\n\n[Privacy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) \\- [Terms](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/)",

    "markdown": "- [Home](https://cascadeur.com/help)\n- [Getting Started](https://cascadeur.com/help/getting_started)\n- Workflow Basics\n\nEN\n\n# Workflow Basics\n\nThis page describes the basics of how animation is created in Cascadeur.\n\n# 1\\. Prepare the Scene\n\nFirst of all, you'll need a scene with a character in it.\n\nCascadeur comes with a number of ready-made scenes.\n\nThese scenes can be found through the [**Splash Window**](https://cascadeur.com/help/interface/splash_window) (see the [**Projects**](https://cascadeur.com/help/interface/splash_window#splash_projects) section).\n\nIf you, however, would prefer to use your own character, you'll first need to [**Import**](https://cascadeur.com/help/getting_started/import_fbxdae) said character into the scene.\n\nOnce the character is in the scene, you'll have to [**Rig**](https://cascadeur.com/help/rig) them so you could then create animations.\n\n# 2\\. Set Poses\n\nAnimation in Cascadeur is made up of _poses_.\n\nThere are several ways to create poses in Cascadeur. The most simple and intuitive is using [**AutoPosing**](https://cascadeur.com/help/tools/animation_tools/autoposing):\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/03/30/e036e1be34d72d9520a3d7af9d6df72e.gif)\n\nIn this mode, you only have to move one or two controllers, - big green points on the character - and the rest of the body would move on its own, creating a realistic pose.\n\nUsually, AutoPosing mode is enabled by default. But even if it isn't, you can always enable it manually, using the switch in the Viewport window:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/03/30/c718c25698ea97908599dc9949b1854f.gif)\n\nThere might, however, be times when you need more control over the pose then AutoPosing provides.\n\nFor cases like that, there are different edit modes.\n\nFirst in the **Point Controller** mode:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/03/30/5a07f6908183466e9a3bc155810776d3.gif)\n\nIn this mode, you can use Point Controllers - small black points - to manually pose the character.\n\nThe process is far less automated, but allows for much more precise control:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/03/29/0258c76fa0ca278cf5868b7cd4b6fa3a.gif)\n\nAnother useful mode is the **Box Controller** mode:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/03/30/b736303a5863d422602cd42e0a8214f2.gif)\n\nThis mode helps to adjust rotations and animate smaller details:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/03/29/ffcf7acb9452e4f8c094708d246a7544.gif)\n\nAll of the above-mentioned controllers are adjusted using **[Manipulators](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/27).**\n\n# 3\\. Manage Keyframes\n\nPoses are stored in [**Keyframes**](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/34). To set up a pose, you first need to create a keyframe for it.\n\nThere are two ways to created keyframes.\n\nFirst, you can manually place keyframes on the **[Timeline](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/14)**:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/03/29/8ac85d481b2aaffe2a638527c02eeca9.gif)\n\nOr you can enable the **Set key on change** option:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/03/30/9d91099e746419afaaea89b25e146537.gif)\n\nWith it enabled, keyframes will be generated automatically when you change the character's pose.\n\nAnd if you need to delete a keyframe, select it and click the **Add or remove key** button on the Timeline (or press **F**):\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/07/06/6703c010939ba8812d21ab300e6412d7.gif)\n\nYou don't need keys for each and every frame - you only have to set a pose for every crucial point of your animation, and you'll get something like this:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/03/29/78a29a71fd72d0e9de387f72f6c943de.gif)\n\n# 4. Add Interpolations\n\nTransitions between these points can be added by creating [**interpolation**](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/21) intervals:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/03/29/ef301a9b2aec97b10342c0d77e04ba84.gif)\n\nBy adding interpolations you create a rough animation draft:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/03/29/bf056851fcd6dcdb6576a21a6dd990ae.gif)\n\n# 5\\. Further Improvement\n\nThis animation draft can be further improved by:\n\n- Applying [**Physics Tools**](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/48) to make character movement physically accurate\n- Polishing resulting animation using tool such as [**Filters**](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/24) and [**Trajectories**](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/23)\n\nThis short description isn't, of course, compendious by any means. The process of creating animation can be as complex as you want it to, and include all kinds of nuances.\n\nSome of these nuances are covered in our [**Animation Guide**](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/46)**.**\n\n# Example\n\nGet Started in Cascadeur \\| Your First Animation Tutorial - YouTube\n\n[Photo image of Cascadeur — Reinventing Animation](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwF6yYbIFJmB5ynAkzq9Psg?embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fcascadeur.com%2F)\n\nCascadeur — Reinventing Animation\n\n64.4K subscribers\n\n[Get Started in Cascadeur \\| Your First Animation Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsMK31XRz2s)\n\nCascadeur — Reinventing Animation\n\nSearch\n\nWatch later\n\nShare\n\nCopy link\n\nInfo\n\nShopping\n\nTap to unmute\n\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\n\nMore videos\n\n## More videos\n\nYou're signed out\n\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

Disable it only when you run into rotation-related problems when exporting your scenes.\n\n**Bake animation**\n\nIf this option is enabled, animation is baked on export, i.e. every frame of the animation is converted into a keyframe (this is done so animation would look the same in any external software regardless of how this software handles interpolation).\n\nAlso enabled by default.\n\n**Fbx up axis**\n\nSets the axis that should be considered the up axis when the scene is exported to FBX format.\n\nThere are two options: **Z** and **Y**. By default, the **Y** axis is selected.\n\n**Leave dialog open**\n\nIf this is enabled, the export window is left open after the scene is exported. Otherwise, it is closed.\n\nDisabled by default.\n\n# Export Video\n\nAnother available option is to export an animation as a video file.\n\nTo do this:\n\n**1.** Select **Export → Video\\|Sequence** from the **File** menu:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2024/04/02/d31809dca309973e0e2d062124168f73.png)\n\n**2.** The **Export video** window will appear:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/02/28/b57d9f2d048eb77349066076a2e6f92e.png)\n\n**3.** In this window, you'll need to set the output parameters for your video file:\n\n**Output To** defines whether the scene should be rendered as a video file (the **video file** option), or as a sequence of pictures (the **image files** option).\n\n**Output Directory** sets the folder to store the rendered scene.\n\n**Output Name** sets the name for the video file/image sequence files.\n\n**Resolution** sets the width and the height of the video/images. Resolution can be set manually or selected from one of the presets (to select a preset, click the square-shaped button to the right from the resolution values).\n\n**Render Quality** defines the quality/level of compression for the video/images. Higher values result in better quality, but also increase the size of the file(s).\n\n**4.** Once the parameters are set, click the **Start rendering** button.\n\n# Export Customization\n\nAnimation export in Cascadeur can be customized within wide limits.\n\nFor example, you can choose which joints should be exported and which to ignore. The same goes for animation: it is possible to manually set types of animation - such as translation, rotation etc. - to be ignored for a particular joint during export.\n\nTo customize animation export:\n\n**1.** Select a joint or a group of joints.\n\n**2.** Go to the [**Object Properties** panel](https://cascadeur.com/help/interface/outliner/object_properties).\n\n**3.** Open the **FBX Export** tab:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/02/28/db68544c458b9494928196bf587932a6.png)\n\nThere, you will find a set of options for controlling how exactly the selected joint(s) (and animation assigned to them) should be exported.\n\nThese options are described in greater detail on the [**Animation Behaviors** page](https://cascadeur.com/help/rig/rig_structure/behaviors/animation_behaviors#behaviors_fbx_export).\n\nNote\n\nThe options have to be set manually for every joint that requires custom export settings.\n\n# Common Problems\n\n## Problems with parsing FBX\n\nIf you are having troubles with using **FBX** files exported from Cascadeur, try using **Collada** instead\n\nFile format can be selected during export, in the **Save File** dialog\n\n## Models are imported with incorrect scale\n\nTry using scale-related options (such as **Scale Compensate** in Maya) when importing Cascadeur models to other software.. If this doesn't help, try using different file formats\n\n## Multiple root bones\n\nDelete the root bones you don't need and leave only one.\n\nA bone can be deleted by:\n\n**1.** Switching to the **Joint Mode**.\n\n**2.** Selecting a bone you want to delete.\n\n**3.** Selecting **Delete objects** from the **Objects** menu (or pressing **Del**).\n\n## See Also\n\n[Import](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/75)\n\n[Export to Unreal Engine](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/79)\n\n[Export to Unity](https://cascadeur.com/help/export_animation_to_unity)\n\nWas this article useful to you?\n\n[Yes](https://cascadeur.com/help/rest/add-mark \"Yes\")\n\n6\n\n[No](https://cascadeur.com/help/rest/add-mark \"No\")\n\n6\n\nreCAPTCHA\n\nRecaptcha requires verification.\n\n[Privacy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) \\- [Terms](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/)\n\nprotected by **reCAPTCHA**\n\n[Privacy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) \\- [Terms](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/)",

You might need several attempts to figure out the exact rotations you need.\n\n### Reimport animations with correct rotations\n\n1\\. In the content browser, **double-click** the animation in the viewer to open it\n\n2\\. Set the necessary rotations\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2020/03/24/1fd84e911b50f52d6c1da92b2a61dfd4.png)\n\n**3.** Save the model/animation\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2020/03/24/89cc8ba25bbdadc4db772755036d512e.png)\n\n**4.** Close the viewer.\n\n**5.** Right-click the model/animation asset and select **Reimport** from the menu\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2020/03/24/f2aa74fac93223b24b8d356987c58d91.jpg)\n\n**6.** After this, the asset will be updated with the new rotations\n\nRotation axis should be manually chosen in each individual case\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2020/03/24/e047c4b5cd1c0641100adab9e69f49cb.png)\n\nHere, for example, the character should be rotated by **90** degrees across **X-axis**:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2020/03/24/34781d100083d6a8c6f2c7afd907cdfa.png)\n\n# Example\n\nCascadeur to UE4 - Custom Character Retargeting - YouTube\n\n[Photo image of Cascadeur — Reinventing Animation](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwF6yYbIFJmB5ynAkzq9Psg?embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fcascadeur.com%2F)\n\nCascadeur — Reinventing Animation\n\n64.4K subscribers\n\n[Cascadeur to UE4 - Custom Character Retargeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrEjKZ5-1qE)\n\nCascadeur — Reinventing Animation\n\nSearch\n\nWatch later\n\nShare\n\nCopy link\n\nInfo\n\nShopping\n\nTap to unmute\n\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\n\nMore videos\n\n## More videos\n\nYou're signed out\n\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

The mesh(es) will be ignored.\n\nThe \"Export to DAZ\" command does the following things:\n\n**1.** Moves ever single point controller of the character's control rig, on each selected frame, by the local position of the Hip joint in the scene's \"Base Pose\" - the pose that the character was using while in Rig Mode.\n\n**2.** Turns off export for translation and scale channels of all body joints.\n\n**3.** Turns off export for the translation, rotation, and scale channels of all face joints, as well as both Pectoral joints.\n\nNote\n\nThe effect of the command can be replicated manually, but doing this is cumbersome and is not recommended.\n\nWarning\n\nIf you're using Cascadeur 2024.3.3 or earlier and Daz Studio 4.23+, download the [corrected \"Export to DAZ\" script](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RAMsYkF9238btZnHXRksXE9MKvW5gVaz/view)\n\nPut this corrected .py file in **\\[Your Cascadeur directoty\\]\\\\resources\\\\scripts\\\\python\\\\commands** folder.\n\nDaz Studio 4.23 uses the \"model pose\" as a reference pose for its imported FBX animations, which isn't included with the exported skeleton animations in Cascadeur 2024.3.3 and earlier. To mitigate that, Daz animation has to be exported with the character mesh, to allow Daz to extract the \"model pose\" from the mesh's \"bind pose\".\n\n# Importing the animation back to Daz Studio\n\nOnce you have successfully exported your animated Daz character from Cascadeur, you can import the animation back to Daz studio:\n\n**1.** Open an empty scene in Daz Studio\n\n**2.** Import your animation using the **\"File -> Import...\"** command\n\n**3.** In the Import options window, turn on the **“Include Animation”** setting and in the dropdown menu below **select the name of the animation take**\n\n**4.** Save the animation as a Pose Preset using the **File -> Save as… -> Pose Preset** command.\n\n![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\n**5.** Create a new empty scene\n\n**6.** Add the character figure that you’ve previously exported from Daz Studio to the scene\n\n**7.** Run the [Daz script \"Prepare figure for animation\"](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pjojvrnymcdi388/Prepare%20Figure%20For%20Animation.dse?dl=0) by double-clicking the script file while the Daz Studio window is active\n\nNote\n\nThis Daz script turns off the Rotation locks and Rotation limits on all joints of the character figure, ensuring that the imported animation plays exactly as it does in Cascadeur\n\n**8.** Switch to the Content Library tab and find the saved Pose Preset in the **“My Library -> Presets -> Poses”** folder.\n\n**9.** Select the figure in the Scene Outliner window, then double-click on the saved Pose Preset to apply the animation to the character figure\n\n**10.** When prompted with the “Preset Exceeds Limits” message, click the **“Leave limits on”** button\n\nIf the “Preset Exceeds Limits” message is missing for you, check that you have the \"Show the Preset Exceeds Limits dialog\" setting turned on\n\n![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\n# Example\n\nCascadeur to Daz 3D - How to Export Animation - YouTube\n\n[Photo image of Cascadeur — Reinventing Animation](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwF6yYbIFJmB5ynAkzq9Psg?embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fcascadeur.com%2F)\n\nCascadeur — Reinventing Animation\n\n64.4K subscribers\n\n[Cascadeur to Daz 3D - How to Export Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHiKCx8nj5k)\n\nCascadeur — Reinventing Animation\n\nSearch\n\nWatch later\n\nShare\n\nCopy link\n\nInfo\n\nShopping\n\nTap to unmute\n\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\n\nMore videos\n\n## More videos\n\nYou're signed out\n\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

If you’re not sure which one works best for you, you can try both and see which one imports correctly.\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2025/04/03/5b9be89915deafc801d0f616944af5e9.png)\n\nThe **Export to Roblox** command does the following:\n\n1\\. Bakes the selected timeline interval, filling it with keyframes\n\n2\\. Removes the control rig, leaving just the joints and the character mesh\n\n3\\. Scales the found root object (Armature or Root) to the scale of 1-1-1.\n\nNote\n\nThe **Export to Roblox** command works only on the Roblox characters with the generated Cascadeur control rig. You can’t use this command on the unrigged model with just the skeleton.\n\n# Importing Animation to Roblox Studio\n\nOnce you have successfully exported your animated Roblox character from Cascadeur, you can import the animation to Roblox Studio:\n\n**1.** Open Roblox Studio.\n\n**2.** Open a world where you want to import your animations. An empty **Classic Baseplate** should be fine.\n\n**3.** In the “Avatar” tab, click on **Rig Builder**. In the appeared window, select your Rig Type (R6 or R15) and click **My Avatar**.\n\nAlternatively, add your target R6 or R15 model to the scene with your preferred choice of plugins and tools:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2025/04/03/1607c2692ff1394d445164699e7ba288.png)\n\n**4.** Move the appeared model wherever you like or reset its Position in the model’s Properties window.\n\n**5.** Select your model and in the same **Avatar** tab open the **Animation Editor**.\n\n**6.** Press the **3-dot** button to the right of the name of your animation. Then, press **Import -> From FBX Animation**:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2025/04/03/3a224126ee0cd4eb55c9e6d9732fa415.png)\n\nNote\n\nRoblox Studio’s Animation Editor tends to cut out the pose in the last frame of the imported animation.\n\nIf you wish to preserve all poses in your animations, adding an additional keyframe at the end of your Cascadeur animation is recommended.\n\nWarning\n\nThe Animation Editor is very sensitive to the contents of the imported scene, such as:\n\n\\- the correct bone orientations in the imported R6/R15 model\n\n\\- the presence or lack of the character mesh\n\n\\- the presence or lack of additional bones, such as Handle bones for props\n\n\\- the character mesh not having the same name as one of the character bones\n\nIf any of these aren’t accounted for, the imported animation may look broken.\n\n**7.** Press the **3-dot** button to the right of the name of your animation. Then, press **Publish to Roblox** to save your animation as an animation clip.\n\nAfter you’ve published your animation, you can continue implementing it into your project.\n\nWas this article useful to you?\n\n[Yes](https://cascadeur.com/help/rest/add-mark \"Yes\")\n\n2\n\n[No](https://cascadeur.com/help/rest/add-mark \"No\")\n\n3\n\nreCAPTCHA\n\nRecaptcha requires verification.\n\n[Privacy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) \\- [Terms](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/)\n\nprotected by **reCAPTCHA**\n\n[Privacy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) \\- [Terms](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/)",

It shows the loaded scene, which you can edit using any tool the program gives you.\n\nBy default, Viewport includes one window. This window can be split into **two** smaller ones by pressing **Shift+Spacebar** and into **four** by presing **Shift+Alt+Spacebar.**\n\nEach one of these smaller windows can be maximized by selecting it with  **![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2019/06/04e916212cae20c3898819cd7986b9ccb9.png)**  and pressing **Shift+Spacebar** or **Shift+Alt+Spacebar** again **.** This way you can also restore Viewport to its initial state.\n\n## (2) Camera (View Cube)\n\nA scene is viewed through a virtual camera\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2022/12/14/ef5486fa77ddf6dbf96b571b7efc8fd0.png)\n\nThe **Viewcube** shows the spatial orientation of the camera and can be used to quickly switch between pre-defined views.\n\nClicking one of the cones switches the camera to one of the six orthogonal perspectives:\n\n**Red \\- the X axis**( **front and back** for standard scenes included in Cascadeur)\n\n**Blue \\- the Z axis**( **right and left** for standard scenes)\n\n**Green \\- the Y axis**( **top and bottom**)\n\nClicking the cube itself switches projection modes between **perspective** and **isometric**.\n\nIf you hold **Ctrl**, moving the mouse over the View Cube would highlight its edges and vertices.\n\nClicking these edges and vertices would then set the camera to the corresponding perspective:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2025/06/10/7dbf13501a954595c42b370abc9f9150.gif)\n\nThe **lock symbol** locks the camera to the current position so it won't move if you try to rotate.\n\nThe locked camera can still be panned and switched between six standard perspectives.\n\n## (3) Edit Mode Switch\n\nThis item is used for switching between [**Edit Modes**](https://cascadeur.com/help/edit_modes).\n\nClicking the switch enables the next Edit Mode:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2022/09/19/263c6d1c8db901cb55f69f852a248a3c.gif)\n\nClicking the sign at the right of the switch opens the list of all available Edit Modes:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2022/09/19/53a5e9260d0a16b47f3dacecb0ad4d61.gif)\n\n## (4) Align to camera\n\nThis item is used for aligning the Viewport to the currently selected [Camera Object](https://cascadeur.com/help/tools/camera_tools).\n\nClicking the triangle icon at the right side of it opens a drop-down menu:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2023/05/24/b1fc7f8a573b50ed7c74e14b25b11d7c.png)\n\n**Add camera**\n\nCreates a new Camera Object.\n\n## Camera Textures\n\nAnother common use case is adding reference images to the camera. This is different from regular [references](https://cascadeur.com/help/animation_pipeline/reference) in that such images are attached directly to the camera - not to an object in the scene - and cover the entire field of view.\n\nThis cannot be done with the default Viewport camera - but can be done with user-added [**Camera Objects**](https://cascadeur.com/help/tools/camera_tools).\n\nSee the [**Camera Textures** section](https://cascadeur.com/help/tools/camera_tools#camera_texture) (on the Camera Tools page) to learn how to do this.\n\n## Visible and Selectable Menus\n\nRight-clicking the Edit Mode Switch opens **Visible** and **Selectable** menus:\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2022/12/14/6ed8c0310e2c2b380cb8e2a358ab846c.png)\n\nBy editing this menus, you can change what types of scene elements you can see and use in each Edit Mode.\n\nThese menus are described in greater detail on the [**Edit Modes** page](https://cascadeur.com/help/edit_modes#edit_modes_custom).\n\n# Customizing Viewport\n\nThe characters - and any other 3d objects too - in the Viewport are lit with a set of light sources. These light sources cannot be moved, but their other parameters can be customized.\n\nFor the intensity of the lights, there  is a set of settings in the [**Settings Window**](https://cascadeur.com/help/interface/main_menu/settings_window), called [**Lights**](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/244):\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2025/06/10/9c2489e9e6eacf62892388aa946ede34.png)\n\n**Ambient Intensity**\n\nThe power of the environment light in the scene (sets the background lighting in the scene).\n\nSet to **0.5** by default.\n\n**Camera Intensity**\n\nThe powers of the ‘front’ light (lights the model from the camera POV).\n\nSet to **0.3** by default.\n\n**Ground Light Intensity**\n\nThe power of the ground light (the source that lights the model from below).\n\nSet to **0.3** by default.\n\n**Sky Light Intensity**\n\nThe power of the sky light (the source that lights the model from above)\n\nSet to **0.7** by default.\n\nThere are also settings for the color of the Viewport background. These settings are not combined into a single group and can be found in the [**Visualizers**](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/257) section instead.\n\nThe ‘sky’ - the upper part of the Viewport background - is rendered as a gradient defined by two colors:\n\n**Sky Color Light**\n\nThe lighter component of the sky gradient.\n\n**Sky Color Dark**\n\nThe darker component of the sky gradient.\n\nThe ‘ground’, i.e. the lower part of the background, is also a gradient, and it too is defined by two colors:\n\n**Earth Surface Color Light**\n\nThe lighter component of the ‘ground’ gradient (i.e. the lower part of the Viewport background).\n\n**Earth Surface Color Dark**\n\nThe darker component of the ‘ground’ gradient.\n\n**Earth Surface Color**\n\n(TODO)\n\n# Detaching Viewport\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2024/03/19/20a33a8f6795ca96f3572abe55c4ee90.png)\n\nThere is also an option to create a separate Viewport window.\n\nThis window is independent from the main Cascadeur window, and can be useful if you, for example, work with a multi-monitor configuration.\n\nThis is done by selecting the **Viewport** option from the [**Window** menu](https://cascadeur.com/help/interface/main_menu/window_menu):\n\n![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2024/03/19/5a74581919600b80edf3dd1c35d161fa.png)\n\n# Viewport Hot Keys​\n\nThe camera can be controlled by holding the **![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2019/06/0490ff226511767f992bf7a3efe077d145.png)** key:\n\n- **![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2019/06/0428a159c572de5f939cdd6c1504f90527.png)**  rotates the camera\n- **![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2019/06/04026cb4d59d6c52068db3403efb6c0eac.png)**  zooms the camera in and out; this can also be done by holding **![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2019/06/047e29fc279ae0e0acaa54eb617ce47bac.png)** and rotating  **![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2019/06/04914e08b1cc6b363f9c84637f14256fef.png)**\n- **![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2019/06/048bd5349cc122aeb00bb5a678a612da73.png)**  pans the camera\n- **![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2019/06/04c2e6c14191ccb8eba72eaeda33248116.png)** switches camera view to the nearest orthogonal projection\n- ![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2019/06/04143d7303caa97e14891fd16148a67630.png), ![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2019/06/04b7b3bc54a7dfced7e054c8721ad06034.png) and  ![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2019/06/04e916212cae20c3898819cd7986b9ccb9.png)  switches the plane when you move the mouse\n- ![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2019/06/042001c533574264e44ebf97f2de8026bf.png) focuses camera on the selected object\n\nEdit Mode hotkeys:\n\n- **![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2021/02/26/87b754b3f0760f6c0e5281ffab9cc6ec.png)** toggles **View Mode**\n- **![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2019/06/04cfe0776123e21bfe6d7baa27f673d252.png) + ![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2021/02/26/87b754b3f0760f6c0e5281ffab9cc6ec.png)** switches between **Point** and **Box Controller** modes\n- **![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2019/06/04cfe0776123e21bfe6d7baa27f673d252.png) + ![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2021/02/26/f80735e01ea1bd576fd8d7a798e6d770.png)** separates the Viewport window in two parts\n- **![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2019/06/04cfe0776123e21bfe6d7baa27f673d252.png) + ![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2019/06/04b7b3bc54a7dfced7e054c8721ad06034.png) + ![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2021/02/26/f80735e01ea1bd576fd8d7a798e6d770.png)** separates the Viewport window in four parts\n\n# See Also\n\n[Camera Tools](https://cascadeur.com/help/camera_tools)\n\n[Main Menu](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/11)\n\n[Toolbar](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/12)\n\n[Selecting Objects](https://cascadeur.com/help/category/54)\n\nWas this article useful to you?\n\n[Yes](https://cascadeur.com/help/rest/add-mark \"Yes\")\n\n8\n\n[No](https://cascadeur.com/help/rest/add-mark \"No\")\n\n6\n\nreCAPTCHA\n\nRecaptcha requires verification.\n\n[Privacy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) \\- [Terms](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/)\n\nprotected by **reCAPTCHA**\n\n[Privacy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) \\- [Terms](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/)",
