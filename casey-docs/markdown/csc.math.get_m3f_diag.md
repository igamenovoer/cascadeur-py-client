# csc.math.get_m3f_diag

## Overview
Returns the three diagonal elements of a 3Ã—3 float32 matrix as a vector. This function is part of the csc.math utilities for working with matrices and vectors in Cascadeur. It accepts a NumPy array of shape (3, 3) and produces a float32 vector with the diagonal values. Further behavioral details are undocumented.

## Function Definition
```python
def get_m3f_diag(matrix: numpy.ndarray[numpy.float32[3, 3]]) -> numpy.ndarray[numpy.float32[3, 1]]
```

## Usage Notes
- Input must be a NumPy float32 array with shape (3, 3).
- Output is a NumPy float32 vector with shape (3, 1), conceptually a Vector3f representing the diagonal.
