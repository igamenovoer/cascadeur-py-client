The **Main Menu** is located at the top of the program window. It includes a number of submenus, each containing a set of tools and functions. Some of these functions are common, like saving and opening files, while others are specific to Cascadeur.

Most of the tools in the program can be accessed from the main menu as well as from [**Toolbar**](https://cascadeur.com/help/interface/toolbar) or [**Timeline**](https://cascadeur.com/help/interface/timeline), and some functions are only available through menus.

The page below lists every submenu and provides a brief description of the tools that can be found there.
