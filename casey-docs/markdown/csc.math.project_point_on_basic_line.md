# csc.math.project_point_on_basic_line

## Overview
Projects a 3D point onto a line defined by a direction vector. This is useful for geometric operations such as finding the closest point on a line in animation and rigging workflows. The function operates on 3D float vectors. Detailed behavior beyond the signature is undocumented.

## Function Definition
```python
def project_point_on_basic_line(
    line_direction: numpy.ndarray[numpy.float32[3, 1]],
    point: numpy.ndarray[numpy.float32[3, 1]],
) -> numpy.ndarray[numpy.float32[3, 1]]
```

### `project_point_on_basic_line(line_direction: numpy.ndarray[numpy.float32[3, 1]], point: numpy.ndarray[numpy.float32[3, 1]]) -> numpy.ndarray[numpy.float32[3, 1]]`
Projects the input 3D point onto the line specified by the direction vector.

- Parameters:
  - line_direction: numpy.ndarray[numpy.float32[3, 1]] – undocumented
  - point: numpy.ndarray[numpy.float32[3, 1]] – undocumented

- Returns: numpy.ndarray[numpy.float32[3, 1]] – undocumented

- Notes: Return type corresponds to a Vector3f.
