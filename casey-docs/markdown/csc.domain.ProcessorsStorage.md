# csc.domain.ProcessorsStorage

**Module:** `csc.domain.ProcessorsStorage`  
**Source:** [Cascadeur Python API Documentation](https://cascadeur.com/python-api/_generate/csc.domain.ProcessorsStorage.html)

## Overview

The `ProcessorsStorage` class serves as a container for entity 3D processors within the Cascadeur domain system. It provides storage and management functionality for processors that handle 3D entity operations.

## Class Definition

```python
class csc.domain.ProcessorsStorage
```

The ProcessorsStorage class manages the storage and organization of 3D entity processors in the Cascadeur animation system.

## Constructor

### `__init__(*args, **kwargs)`

Initializes a new ProcessorsStorage instance.

**Parameters:**
- `*args`: Variable length argument list
- `**kwargs`: Arbitrary keyword arguments

## Usage Example

```python
import csc.domain

# Create a processors storage instance
storage = csc.domain.ProcessorsStorage()

# The storage is used to contain and manage entity 3D processors
# Specific processor operations would depend on the actual implementation
```

## Usage Notes

- ProcessorsStorage is designed to contain and manage entity 3D processors
- This class is part of the domain layer architecture in Cascadeur
- It provides centralized storage for processors that handle 3D entity operations
- The specific processor types and operations depend on the Cascadeur system implementation
- This class facilitates organized management of computational processors for 3D entities
