# Timeline Menu

![](https://cascadeur.com/images/category/2025/04/28/4e2e740f1cf0ce01777790c3a590c35c.png)

These options are used for manipulating the [**Timeline**](https://cascadeur.com/help/timeline). Most of the Timeline functionality can be accessed through this menu.

**Add frame(s)**

_=_ or _Num + +_

Extends the Timeline by adding a frame at the Current Frame Pointer.

**Remove frames**

_-_ or _Num + -_

Shrinks the Timeline by removing the frame after the current key.

**Increase scroll bar max frame**

_Ctrl + =_ or _Ctrl + +_

Extends the part of the Timeline available for editing.

**Decrease scroll bar max frame**

_Ctrl + -_

Shrinks the part of the Timeline available for editing.

**Add/remove key**

_F_

Creates a new [**keyframe**](https://cascadeur.com/help/keyframes) on the current frame.

If the current frame already has a key, it is removed.

**Add/remove key on interval**

_Alt + F_

Creates a keyframe for every frame on the selected interval.

If the interval already has only keys, they are removed.

**Change IK/FK key**

_Shift + F_

Switches interpolation on the selected keyframe [between IK and FK](https://cascadeur.com/help/interpolation#ik_and_fk_interpolation).

**Change  IK/FK key on interval**

_Alt + Shift + F_

Switches keys on the selected interval between IK and FK.

**Change to fulcrum key**

_Shift + R_

Converts the selected keyframe into a fulcrum key.

Physical simulation is not applied to Fulcrum keys. Therefore, controllers on these keys can be stretched and squeezed.

Unlike the regular fixing tool (link), Fulcrum keys affect all the points on the track. They also work only with selected frames and interpolations associated with these frames.

**Change to fulcrum key on interval**

_Alt + Shift + R_

Converts every keyframe on a selected interval into fulcrum keys.

If every keyframe on the interval is already a fulcrum key, they are converted back into normal keyframes.

**Change label**

Adds a [**label**](https://cascadeur.com/help/keyframes#keyframe_lable) to the selected keyframe, or removes it if the key already has one.

**Play**

_X_

Plays the animation starting with the current frame.

**Keyframe play**

_Ctrl + X_

Also plays the animation, but only keyframes are taken into account, while interpolations are ignored.

**Merge tracks**

_Ctrl + E_

Combines selected [**Animation Tracks**](https://cascadeur.com/help/animation_tracks) into one.

**Move selected tracks up**

_PgUp_

Moves up in the Animation Track hierarchy.

**Move selected tracks down**

_PgDown_

Moves down in the Animation Track hierarchy.

**Resize Interval**

Allows to change the size of the currently selected interval.
