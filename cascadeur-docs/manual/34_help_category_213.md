# Export Usd

In addition to FBX and Collada formats, Cascadeur also supports exporting scenes into Universal Scene Description (\*.usd) files. This page describes how to do this.

The following types of objects can be imported:

- [3d meshes](https://cascadeur.com/help/rig/rig_structure/rig_elements/meshes)
- [Joints](https://cascadeur.com/help/rig/rig_structure/rig_elements/joints)
- Animation assigned to joints
- Additional objects (cameras etc.)

To export a scene (or a part of it) to USD format, use the **File â†’ Export Usd** menu:

There are two options available:

**Model**

Exports a model in .usd format (animation is not included).

**Scene**

Exports a whole scene in .usd forms (including character models, animation and additional objects).
