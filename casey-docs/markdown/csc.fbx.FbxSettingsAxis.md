# csc.fbx.FbxSettingsAxis

## Overview
FbxSettingsAxis is an enumeration that identifies coordinate axes used in FBX-related settings within Cascadeur. Use it to reference the X, Y, or Z axis when configuring or querying axis-dependent options. This provides a consistent way to specify axis choices in workflows that depend on axis orientation.

## Class Definition
```python
class csc.fbx.FbxSettingsAxis
```

## Constructor

### __init__(self, value)
Initializes an enumeration member; typically not called directly by users.

**Parameters:**
- value: undocumented

**Returns:**
- undocumented

## Attributes
- X: Represents the X axis.
- Y: Represents the Y axis.
- Z: Represents the Z axis.
- name: The member name (undocumented details).

## Usage Notes
- Prefer using predefined members (e.g., FbxSettingsAxis.X) rather than calling the constructor.
